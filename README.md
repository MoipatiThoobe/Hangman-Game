# Hangman Game

## Project Description
This project is a Harry Potter themed hangman game created using React. The player is given a blank word. If the player types in a correct letter its position is revealed in the word. If the player types in an incorrect letter, a part of the stick figure is drawn. The aim of the game is to correctly guess the game before the stick man is hanged. 

## Installation Section 
Ensure that you have node installed on your system. If not download node at https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have installed node open your command terminal and type cd and the file's directory. Then type npm start to run the app. 


## Usage section
Once the app has started running the player will see the game. The player is given a blank word and they need to type in letters to try and guess the word. If the player types in the same letter twice they will receive a notification. The correct letters will be revealed in their places within the word. Incorrect letters will result in more parts of the stick figure being drawn. If the stick figure is completely drawn then the player has lost the game. If the user has correctly guessed the word then they have won the game. Once the game is complete the player will see a pop up message asking if they would like to play again.
